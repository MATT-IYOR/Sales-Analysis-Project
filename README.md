### Tools

- Power BI- For data cleaning and Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

### Cleaning

1. I uploaded the dataset into Power Query
2. I cheked for incorrect data type and corected them
3. Merge separated Year,Month and Day columns to create a single date column
4. Check for missing values
5. Remove duplicates

### Preparation

I created the following measures for visualization that would help with getting the result needed.

1. Average order value and average order value percentage
2. Toatal customers and total customer percentage
3. Total sales and total sales percentage

EDA involved exploring the Sales dataset to answer the following questions

- What is the total revenue over time?
- Which products are the top-selling by quantity and revenue?
- How does sales performance vary across countries?
- What are the monthly or seasonal sales trends?
- Who are the top customers by sales value?

### Results/Findings


### Recomendations

Norway in 2020 shows the highest online sales and lowest return rates, we recommend expanding Norway-targeted marketing campaigns 
and inventory for online channels in that region
